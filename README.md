# Challenge Bain & Company: Climate Impact Mitigation Project

# Project README: Climate Impact Mitigation Project

## Overview
This repository contains the solution for a climate impact mitigation challenge focusing on Brazilian agriculture and livestock in the Amazon region, specifically in the state of Pará. The objective is to design a set of strategic initiatives to mitigate the climate impact while maintaining the growth of this sector. The project encompasses multiple workstreams, each addressing different aspects of the challenge.

## Case Introduction
The Nature Conservancy’s (TNC) strategy director requested our assistance in developing a strategic plan to address the environmental impact of agribusiness in the Amazon region. The goal is to identify key areas and propose solutions to reduce carbon emissions while supporting sustainable practices. This project was undertaken as a case study exercise to demonstrate problem-solving capabilities and to contribute to the broader mission of TNC.

### Workstreams
The project is divided into four workstreams, each with specific goals:

1. **Case for Change & Ambition**: This workstream focuses on understanding and quantifying the environmental impact of agriculture and livestock in the Amazon region, particularly in the state of Pará. The aim is to calculate the potential reduction in equivalent carbon emissions resulting from the proposed project.

2. **Where to Play**: This workstream identifies the regions and product types where TNC should focus its efforts. These areas are characterized by high demand from the agribusiness sector and deteriorating environmental conditions.

3. **How to Win**: This workstream maps the critical levers for mitigating the environmental impact of agribusiness, providing guidance to achieve the project's ambition.

4. **Implementation Roadmap & Enablers**: This workstream outlines the strategic initiatives required for the plan's execution and tracks its results. It also identifies the enablers necessary for successful implementation.

## Technical Details
A database file, `historical-database.csv`, provides timeseries data up to 2017, with the following columns: year, city_code, product_type, product, and destinated_area. The task was to predict the area designated for each product and city for the years 2018 and 2019. A technical documentation file explains how to submit results and how the model's performance is evaluated.

## Personal Reflection
This project was an opportunity for me to put my analytical skills to the test and to contribute to a meaningful cause. I approached this challenge with dedication and applied my knowledge to create a model that could assist in strategic planning for TNC. Although the project had its complexities, I gave my best in completing the assigned tasks in October 2022.

## Conclusion
The repository serves as a record of my participation in this challenge and showcases my ability to work on environmental impact projects. It reflects my commitment to learning and my enthusiasm for applying data science to real-world problems. I hope that the outcomes of this project can positively influence future initiatives in climate impact mitigation.
